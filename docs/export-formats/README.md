# Export formats

{{ $frontmatter.draft_reminder }}

In order to make usage of the {{ $frontmatter.table_name }} as easy as possible, it is important the table can be exported into formats that are native to the medium used for writing and display. The `raw-format` is the fundamental representation of a {{ $frontmatter.table_name }}.

Whenever possible, the table should also lend itself to be copy-able in the the `raw-format` outlined in the main spec. This may not always be possible and can be considered a lower-priority target for the format. 

::: tip Reminder
It will be tempting to include a rasterised image version (i.e. PNG or JPEG) in manuscripts. While the option will be offered in the official editor, this practice is highly discouraged.
